# Dolly 2.0 on IPUs

![Dolly logo](dolly-logo.png)

Dolly 2.0 is a 12B parameter language model from Databricks. The large language model (LLM) has been trained and instruction fine-tuned making it better suited for human interactivity. Crucially, Databricks released all code, model weights, and their fine-tuning dataset with an open-source license that permits commercial use. This makes Dolly 2.0 the world's first truly open-source instruction-tuned LLM, ready for you to run and test out with your own prompts via a Paperspace notebook.

In this Paperspace Gradient notebook, you will learn how to run Dolly 2.0 with your own prompts using IPUs. The IPU (Intelligence Processing Unit) is a completely new kind of massively parallel processor designed to accelerate machine intelligence. Create and configure a Dolly inference pipeline, then run Dolly inference on a text prompt to generate answers to questions specified by users.
