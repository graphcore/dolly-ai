# Dolly 2.0

<p align="center"><img width="500" alt="Dolly logo" src="dolly-logo.png"></p>

Dolly 2.0 is a 12B parameter language model trained and instruction fine-tuned by Databricks. By instruction fine-tuning the large language model (LLM), we obtain an LLM better suited for human interactivity. Crucially, Databricks released all code, model weights, and their fine-tuning dataset with an open-source license that permits commercial use. This makes Dolly 2.0 the world's first, truly open-source instruction-tuned LLM.

In this Paperspace Gradient notebook, we show you how to run Dolly 2.0 using Graphcore IPUs on Paperspace with your own prompts. You will create and configure a Dolly inference pipeline and run Dolly inference on a text prompts to generate answers to user specified questions.
